              <p> The code we write can be viewed and inspected in the web browser, phone or tablet device. It's almost like design, but with computer code. We control the size / width of elements, where they are positioned on the page, colors, font sizes, etc. </p>

                <li>Front-end developers primarily use HTML, CSS, PHP & Javascript development languages</li>
                <li>  We also use frameworks or libraries that are built off of the above languages. VUE, React, Tailwind (uhum Josh, Jerred's favorite - thank you Jerred!) Frameworks make building things faster, easier.

                <li> The browser's console / inspector is his best friend. This tool allows us to monitor front end code in real time. We can also make adjustments and they are visible to us as soon as we make them.</li>

                <li>Build using responsive support / multi-device support. Itâ€™s 2023 and you can expect a website visitor to be using various devices. </li>

            <li> 1. Get assigned project via Clickup and take a look at the assets provided to us. This is a time to do time estimates, ask for assets or ask questions.</li>
            <li> 2. Gather all assets. Images, fonts, content, design.</li>
            <li> 3. Start building the project in our code editor. We also keep in mind where the final site will be viewed. Bind, WordPress, HubSpot. </li>
            <li> 4. Finalize the build, add a userback snippet and submit to internal review. </li>
            <li> 5. Take care of edits that come through. </li>
            <li> 6. Once all of the above is completed, we can deploy the site live.</li>
